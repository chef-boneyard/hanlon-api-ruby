# Hanlon::Api

A simple Ruby API client for the Hanlon RESTful API. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hanlon-api'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hanlon-api

## Why?

Because the Hanlon code has too many dependencies if all you want to do
is make HTTP calls to it, and currently the API calls are tightly
coupled to CLI code. This may only be temporary; it may be better to
split up the Hanlon code base to make this better for all parties, but
until then this works.

## Usage

Examples coming soon.
